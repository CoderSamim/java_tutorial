String and StringBuffer are similar and use similar method (length, subString, indexOf, lastIndexOf)

String immutable/can not be modified. but StringBuffer are mutable/can be modified

//how to create StringBuffer object

StringBuffer sb= new StringBuffer();
or, 
   StringBuffer sb= new StringBuffer("hello");

// some method for StringBuffer

1. sb.append("hi");   //add at last
2. sb.insert(1,"lol");   // add at index 1st
3. sb.delete(2,7);  // delete from 2nd to 6th index
4. sb.reverse();
5. sb.replace(1,8, "lol");    //replace characters from 1st to 7th by lol
                     //in string replace all m by n   // str.replace(m,n)


6. convert the StringBuffer object into a String

sb.toString();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
StringBuffer is similar to StringBuilder

## synchronized : does not allow more than one 1 thread to act simultaneously on the object.

StringBuffer is synchronized but StringBuilder is not.

1. if use several threads , then use StringBuffer for reliable result.
2. if used only one thread , then use StringBuilder for improves execution time.
